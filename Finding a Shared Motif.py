"""Problem"""
#  A common substring of a collection of strings is a substring of every member of the
#  collection. We say that a common substring is a longest common substring if there does
#  not exist a longer common substring. For example, "CG" is a common substring of
#  "ACGTACGT" and "AACCGTATA", but it is not as long as possible; in this case,
#  "CGTA" is a longest common substring of "ACGTACGT" and "AACCGTATA".

# Note that the longest common substring is not necessarily unique; for a simple example,
#  "AA" and "CC" are both longest common substrings of "AACC" and "CCAA".

# Given: A collection of k (kâ‰¤100) DNA strings of length at most 1 kbp each in FASTA format.

# Return: A longest common substring of the collection. (If multiple solutions exist,
# you may return any single solution.)

# Sample Dataset
# >Rosalind_1
# GATTACA
# >Rosalind_2
# TAGACCA
# >Rosalind_3
# ATACA

# Sample Output
# AC
